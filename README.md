# Weather Application

In this project, we'll be creating a fully functioning website that'll display the temperature of any city throughout the world in real-time using the OpenWeatherMap.org API, Node.js + Express.js.

# Project Setup

<li>OpenWeatherMap.org account. It’s a quick 20 second signup. After creating an account, acquire the free API by creating a key on "Current Weather API".</li>
<li>Node.js: Visit the official Node.js website to download and install Node if you haven’t already. Moreover, install the npm</li>

1.) Create an empty directory named *weather-app*

2.) Open up your console, navigate to initialize the project.

3.) Fill out the required information to init the project when creating a package.json file.

4.) Within the *weather-app* directory, create a file name *server.js* - this file will house the code for our application.

Now we can start building.
